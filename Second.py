#Built in function
"""
In Python we have lots of built-in functions. Built-in functions are globally available for your use that 
mean you can make use of the built-in functions without importing or configuring. 
Some of the most commonly used Python built-in functions are the following: 
print(), len(), type(), int(), float(), str(),
input(), list(), dict(), min(), max(), sum(), 
sorted(), open(), file(), help(), and dir().
"""

>>> print("hello")
hello
>>> min([10,20,2,30])
2
>>> max([30,20,30,50,50])
50
>>> sum([28,23,43,54])
148
>>> len('hellloooo')
9
>>> type(5)
<class 'int'>
>>> type("hxp")
<class 'str'>
>>> type(1.0)
<class 'float'>
>>> int('10')
10
>>> float(10)
10.0
>>> input("Enter your first name:")
Enter your first name:Raj
'Raj'
